Wenzhi Hu develops and publishes apps for mobile devices. In this policy, "SmartKeyboard" may also refer to  "SmartKeyboard", "We" or "Us".

This Agreement requires the use of arbitration on an individual basis to resolve disputes, rather than jury trials or class actions, and also limits the remedies available to you in the event of a dispute.

This Terms of Service (“Agreement”) sets forth the legally binding terms for your use of any App (including any related services provided by SmartKeyboard). By using any App, you are accepting this Agreement and you represent and warrant that you have the right, authority, and capacity to enter into this Agreement. If you do not agree with all of the provisions of this Agreement, please do not use any App. This Agreement is the final, complete and exclusive agreement of you and SmartKeyboard with respect to the subject matters hereof (including the Apps) and supersedes and merges all prior discussions and agreements between the parties with respect to such subject matters (including any prior End User License Agreements, Terms of Service or Privacy Policy).

1.  End User License Agreement
